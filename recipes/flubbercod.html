	<h2><em>What is fried flubbercod?</em></h2>
	<p>Flubbercod is a fake fish found in the fake pacific ocean. It is a very gamey fish that probably tastes
		delicious when fried to the gills!</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 whole flubbercod</li>
		<li>Cane sugar</li>
		<li>Whole wheat flour</li>
		<li>Table salt</li>
		<li>Yarn</li>
		<li>Unsalted butter</li>
		<li>Old bay seasoning</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What to do</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Slaughter the flubbercod by slamming a knife down on its torso bisectionally. It is important that
			you do not puncture its head in any way.</li>
		<li>Stick the entire stick of butter inside the fish's open wound.</li>
		<li>Take a fistful of the cane sugar and swallow it.</li>
		<li>Nap for 30-45 minutes.</li>
		<li>What were we doing again?</li>
		<li>Right, now you're going to tie a piece of yarn around the flubbercod's neck like a noose. This is
			to make sure none of the sour flavor from the flubbercod's head trickles down into its delicious
			body.</li>
		<li>Salt bae the flour onto the flubbercod until it is completely immersed. This will take about 3
			hours.</li>
		<li>Pray to the Lord for forgiveness.</li>
		<li>Heat a pan skillet on high for about 10 minutes. It is very important that you keep the heat on high
			for the entirety of the time.</li>
		<li>Put out the fire.</li>
		<li>Stand about 10 feet away from the pan and shoot the flubbercod onto it like a basketball. Repeat as
			many times until the flubbercod successfully lands onto the pan.</li>
		<li>Let the flubbercod cook for about 4 minutes and then rip it off the pan as we forgot to add oil.
		</li>
		<li>Dump half of the old bay onto the flubbercod. It doesn't matter what quantity you have. Dump half.
		</li>
		<li>Enjoy your delicious seafood meal!</li>
